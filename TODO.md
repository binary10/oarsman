# TODO

* Web interface read-only mode to see workouts and splits.
* Web interface workout mode, to monitor real-time the workout data.
* Allow importing .erg file to define workout, then visualize on the
  web interface during workout mode, ala TrainerRoad.
* Native app mode, via
  [Node-WebKit](https://github.com/jyapayne/Web2Executable)
* [Strava integration](https://github.com/strava/go.strava) for uploads
* Switch to 1Hz for export
* Allow the list command to write onto a CSV file (similar to
  C2Utility) with splits.
* Rename the workout command to something more meaningful, e.g. train.  
* Automatically create laps every 2,000 meters during import; store
  this in the database and use it for listing, export, web, etc.
